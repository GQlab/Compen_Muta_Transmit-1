# Abstract of this Article
It has been suggested that compensatory mutations can promote multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) transmission, but their role in facilitating recent transmission of MDR-TB is unclear. To investigate the epidemiological significance of compensatory mutations, we analyzed a four-year population-based collection of MDR-TB strains from Shanghai, China, and 1,346 published global MDR-TB strains. We report that MDR-TB strains with compensatory mutations in rpoA, rpoB or rpoC genes were not more frequently clustered, nor found in larger clusters than those without compensatory mutations. Our results suggest that compensatory mutations are not a major contributor to the current epidemic MDR-TB.
